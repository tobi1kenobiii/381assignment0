# 381assignment0

There are two sets of instructions below: one for those who were able to do just the minimal software install (R, Rstudio, tidyverse), and a second set for those who were able to install all of the software (R, Rstudio, tidyverse, rmarkdown, tinytex, git.)

## Minimal instalation

The following instructions assume that: 

1) you have a minimal installation of R, Rstudio, and the tidyverse, as described here: https://github.com/rpmartin/Rinstall

2) I have uploaded the data and the .R and .Rmd files (you should see them listed above)

Steps:

Click on the green button labeled code.

Click on download zip file.

Unzip the downloaded file somewhere you can find it.

open Rstudio.

click on File in the top menu bar, then New Project, then Existing Directory, then choose the unzipped directory.

Open file solutions_assignment0.R

Ensure that your cursor is at the top of the file solutions_assignment0.R (the file is open in the top-left box in Rstudio). 
Run the code by repeatedly hitting both control and enter. 
By doing so you step through the code line by line, and in the bottom left panel you see the results of each line of code. 
The last line of code creates your first graph, which should show up in the bottom right panel.

There should be no errors (yet ;) when you run the code of solutions_assignment0.R. If there are errors, do not proceed further! 
Get in touch either by email or on the message board. 

Open solutions_assignment0.docx

Enter your name and student ID at the top, and “sign” your academic integrity statement (replace name here with your name).

Insert file first_plot.jpeg where it says [insert first_plot.jpeg here]

Save you changes, and submit on brightspace, you are done!

## Full software instalation

The following instructions assume that 

1) you have installed and tested R, Rstudio, tidyverse, Rmarkdown and tinytex, as described here: https://github.com/rpmartin/Rinstall

2) I have uploaded the data and the .R and .Rmd files (you should see them listed above)

Steps:

Click on the green button labeled code.

Click on the clipboard icon to copy address to clipboard (the icon is to the right of the text box.)

open Rstudio.

click on File in the top menu bar, then New Project, then Version Control, then Git.

Where it asks for Repository URL paste (control V) from your clipboard (this should be what you copied from step 3)

R chooses the name of the folder in which you will be working, but you should choose where you want this folder saved.

Click Create Project and Rstudio will start in this folder, and all the files you need have been cloned into this folder from github.

Open file solutions_assignment0.R

Ensure that your cursor is at the top of the file solutions_assignment0.R (the file is open in the top-left box in Rstudio). 
Run the code by repeatedly hitting both control and enter. 
By doing so you step through the code line by line, and in the bottom left panel you see the results of each line of code. 
The last line of code creates your first graph, which should show up in the bottom right panel.

There should be no errors (yet ;) when you run the code of solutions_assignment0.R. If there are errors, do not proceed further! 
Get in touch either by email or on the message board. 
Only once you have checked that there are no errors in your solutions_assignment0.R file should you open up solutions_assignment0.Rmd file.

In the solutions_assignment0.Rmd file enter your name and student ID at the top, and “sign” your academic integrity statement (replace name here with your name).

Knit your solutions_assignment0.Rmd file by hitting the knit button (there is a ball of yarn with a needle sticking out of it beside the word knit). 
This is called knitting because we are “weaving” together R code (that produces graphs and tables) and prose.

A new window should open with your assignment… submit it on Brightspace, you are done!
